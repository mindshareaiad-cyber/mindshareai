Here’s an updated Replit Agent prompt that keeps everything AEO‑only but tells it to design the landing page and dashboard in a ClickUp‑style (section structure, tone, layout).

Copy‑paste this into Replit Agent:

Prompt for Replit Agent (AEO SaaS app, ClickUp‑style UI)

I want you to build a full‑stack SaaS web app, hosted entirely on Replit, focused ONLY on Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and AI visibility for businesses.

Use the structure, layout patterns, and tone from 
https://clickup.com
 as inspiration for the marketing landing page and in‑app dashboard design. The content is different (AEO visibility, not productivity), but the UX should feel similar: bold hero, clear value props, solution sections by use case, and a clean, modern dashboard layout.

1. High‑level product description
Build an “AI Visibility & AEO Dashboard” that helps businesses see if and how often their brand is mentioned or recommended by AI assistants (ChatGPT‑style models) for a set of buyer‑style questions, and then gives them a prioritized list of AEO actions.

The app must:

Accept a brand, competitors, and prompt sets.

Call an LLM API to ask those prompts and capture the answers.

Score visibility for each brand.

Aggregate that into an AI Visibility Score and reports.

Stay focused on AEO / AI search visibility only (no generic chatbots, no unrelated AI features).

Use:

Backend: Python + FastAPI.

Frontend: React (Vite or CRA) within the same Replit project.

DB: SQLite via SQLAlchemy.

AI provider: OpenAI Chat Completions API (I will add OPENAI_API_KEY as an env var).

Follow FastAPI best practices.
​

2. Data model (unchanged core)
Implement these entities:

Project

id (UUID string)

name (string)

brand_name (string)

brand_domain (string)

competitors (array of strings)

prompt_sets (relationship)

PromptSet

id (UUID)

project_id (FK → Project)

name

persona (optional: “founder”, “marketing manager”, “consumer”)

funnel_stage (optional: “TOFU”, “MOFU”, “BOFU”)

country (optional)

prompts (relationship)

Prompt

id (UUID)

prompt_set_id (FK)

text (question like “best CRM for startups in the UK”)

Scan

id (UUID)

project_id (FK)

created_at (datetime)

engines (JSON array, e.g. ["openai-gpt-4o-mini"])

ScanResult

id (UUID)

scan_id (FK)

prompt_id (FK)

engine (string)

answer (text)

brand_score (int: 0, 1, 2)

competitor_scores (JSON: { "Competitor A": 2, "Competitor B": 1 })

The backend must be able to compute:

Project AI Visibility Score (avg brand_score across prompts/engines).

Share of voice vs competitors.
​

3. Backend API routes
Under /api, implement:

POST /api/projects

GET /api/projects/{project_id}

POST /api/projects/{project_id}/prompt-sets

GET /api/projects/{project_id}/prompt-sets

POST /api/projects/{project_id}/scans

Fetch all prompts for the project.

For each prompt:

Call LLM to generate an answer.

Call LLM again to score visibility for brand + competitors.

Save Scan + ScanResult rows.

Return scan summary (visibility score, counts, engine).

GET /api/projects/{project_id}/scans/latest

GET /api/projects/{project_id}/gaps

Prompts where brand_score == 0 and any competitor_score > 0.

Use separate modules: models.py, schemas.py, routes/, llm_client.py.
​

4. LLM integration (AEO‑specific)
In llm_client.py:

async def generate_answer(prompt_text: str) -> str

Use openai.chat.completions.create with model="gpt-4o-mini".

System prompt:

You are an expert assistant answering user questions about products, services, and businesses. Provide a concise, practical answer in under 120 words, suitable for being used as an AI result.

async def score_visibility(answer: str, brand_name: str, brand_domain: str, competitors: list[str]) -> tuple[int, dict]

System prompt:

You are an evaluation engine scoring brand visibility in AI answers for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO). You only output strict JSON.

User prompt template:

You will receive:

An AI answer to a user’s question.

One primary brand (name + domain).

A list of competitor brand names.

Assign a visibility score for the primary brand and each competitor:

2 = clearly recommended or strongly endorsed

1 = mentioned but not the main recommendation

0 = not mentioned at all

Output STRICT JSON with this shape:
{
"brand_score": 0,
"competitor_scores": { "Competitor 1": 0, "Competitor 2": 0 }
}

ANSWER:
"""{ANSWER_TEXT}"""

BRAND:

name: {BRAND_NAME}

domain: {BRAND_DOMAIN}

COMPETITORS:

{COMPETITOR_LIST}

Parse JSON and return brand_score, competitor_scores. Use this only for AEO scoring.
​

5. ClickUp‑style marketing landing page (React)
Build a marketing site at / that takes clear inspiration from ClickUp’s layout and flow (but content is about AI visibility / AEO):

Hero section (like ClickUp’s)

Big headline:

Example: “Get your brand into AI’s answers.”

Sub‑headline:

“See when ChatGPT and other AI assistants recommend you—or ignore you—and get a playbook to fix it.”

Primary CTA: “Run an AI Visibility Scan”.

Secondary CTA: “Watch demo” (can be placeholder).

Visual: dashboard mockup style (simple React UI / image) similar to ClickUp’s hero style.
​

“AI solutions for every team”‑style section
Inspired by ClickUp’s “AI solutions for every team”, create 3–4 cards like:
​

“For SaaS & B2B marketers”

“For agencies”

“For local & services businesses”
Each card shows:

Short description of how they use AI visibility.

3–4 bullet “REPLACES” style points (e.g. manual prompt checks, messy screenshots, ad‑hoc reports).

Feature sections (ClickUp style)
Use sections similar to ClickUp’s “Deliver projects on time”, “Maximize marketing’s impact”, etc., but for AEO:

a) “Know when AI actually recommends you”

Bullet list of core scanner features.

Mention AI Visibility Score and share of voice.
​

b) “Turn gaps into an AEO roadmap”

Explain gap list + suggested answers + page types.
​

c) “Designed for growth teams and agencies”

Mention multi‑project, multi‑brand, white‑label reports.
​

Social proof / ROI section
Similar structure to ClickUp’s ROI numbers, but generic placeholders (no fake stats):
​

“Save hours of manual AI prompt checking.”

“See where AI should mention you but doesn’t.”

“Give your team a clear AEO backlog in minutes.”

Pricing section
3 columns: Starter, Growth, Pro (no Enterprise). Show the limits and features by tier based on:

Projects

Prompts

Engines

Scans per month

Reports / alerts availability.

Overall styling: clean, modern, similar layout to ClickUp: big typography, section bands, iconography if possible.
​

6. In‑app dashboard (ClickUp‑inspired layout)
When a user is “inside” the app (after they click “Open app” / “Go to dashboard”), use a layout inspired by ClickUp’s app:

Left sidebar:

Projects list (like ClickUp’s spaces/projects).

Top bar:

Project name, AI Visibility Score, “Run scan” button.

Main content with tabs/sections:

Overview tab

Cards similar to ClickUp’s “overview” metrics:
​

AI Visibility Score (0–2 with color).

Number of prompts.

Number of engines.

Last scan time.

Prompts & Sets tab

Similar to ClickUp’s lists: show PromptSets and prompts in a structured list with filters.

Results tab

Table view with sorting and filters: prompt, brand score, competitor scores.

Toggle: “Show gaps only”.

AEO Suggestions tab

List of gap prompts with generated short answers and suggested page types.

Visually mimic ClickUp’s principles: clear sections, cards, headings, “REPLACES” style bullet lists, but keep all wording about AI visibility and AEO marketing.
​

7. AEO‑specific metrics & logic
Implement helpers:

AI Visibility Score (average brand_score latest scan).

Competitor share of voice (fraction of prompts where competitor_score > 0).
​

Expose in GET /api/projects/{project_id}/scans/latest and use in Overview tab and the landing page demo mockup.

8. Non‑functional
Use OPENAI_API_KEY env var, no hardcoded keys.

Configure CORS so React frontend can call FastAPI.
​

Add README.md describing:

Purpose (AEO / AI visibility only).

Stack.

How to run in Replit.

Build the project end‑to‑end exactly for this AEO use case, with marketing and dashboard UI patterns inspired by ClickUp’s site and app, but no unrelated features.
