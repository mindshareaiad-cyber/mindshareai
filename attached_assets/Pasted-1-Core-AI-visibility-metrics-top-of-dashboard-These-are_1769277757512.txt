1. Core AI visibility metrics (top of dashboard)
These are the “headline” stats:

AI Visibility Score

Numeric 0–2 or 0–100 index based on your brand_score across all prompts.
​

AI Mention Count

Total prompts where your brand is mentioned (score ≥1) in the latest scan.
​

AI Recommendation Count

Total prompts where your brand is clearly recommended / top choice (score = 2).
​

Share of Voice (%)

Your percentage of mentions vs competitors for all monitored prompts.
​

Trend vs last scan / last 30 days

Simple ↑ / ↓ next to each metric (change in Visibility Score, mentions, SoV).
​

2. Prompt‑level performance (tactical table)
Per prompt, so teams can see where they win/lose:

For each prompt row:
​

Prompt text (e.g. “best CRM for startups”).

Prompt set labels (persona, funnel stage, country).

Brand visibility score (0/1/2).

Each competitor’s score.

Engine(s) tested (DeepSeek, etc.).

Last change indicator (e.g. “Improved since last scan” / “New gap”).

Filters:

Show only gaps (brand_score = 0 & competitor > 0).

Filter by funnel stage or persona (TOFU/MOFU/BOFU, founder vs marketer).
​

3. Competitor and citation metrics
To make it feel like true AEO intelligence, not just self‑tracking:

Competitor share of voice table

Each brand → Visibility Score, Mention Count, Recommendation Count, Share of Voice %.
​

AI Citation Count (later feature)

How many times your domain/URLs are cited across answers in the scan.
​

AI Competitor Share

How often competitors appear instead of you in your key prompts.
​

4. Content / AEO opportunity metrics
This is where the product starts to feel like an AEO tool, not just analytics.
​

Gap opportunities count

Number of prompts where:

You rank in Google but are not mentioned in AI answers (if you integrate SEO later).

Or simply: brand_score = 0 but competitor > 0.

Top 10 prompts to fix (Content Opportunity Tracker)
For each:

Prompt text.

Estimated intent (TOFU/MOFU/BOFU).

Potential impact score (simple heuristic).

Suggested content type (FAQ, comparison page, pricing page, etc.).
​

Suggested answer snippet

A short AI‑generated answer they can paste into their content.

5. Historical / timeline metrics
Even if you don’t integrate GSC/GA yet, you can still give good historical AEO signals:
​

Timeline of:

AI Visibility Score per scan.

Share of Voice vs a chosen competitor.

Total AI mentions over time.

Optional (later):

Correlate big jumps or drops with:

AEO changes (content updates).

Major AI platform updates (you can annotate).
​

If your dashboard exposes these data points—especially the core metrics + gap list + “top prompts to fix”—it stops feeling bare and starts looking like something you’d happily pay ££ for and show in a marketing meeting.
