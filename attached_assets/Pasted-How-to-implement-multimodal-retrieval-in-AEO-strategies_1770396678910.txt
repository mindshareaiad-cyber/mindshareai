How to implement multimodal retrieval in AEO strategies
Multimodal retrieval in AEO = making sure answer engines can find and fuse your text, images, video, and audio as a single, coherent “answer package.” Here’s how to implement it in a practical, systems‑driven way.

1. Start with use‑cases and questions, not formats
Before you touch tech, define the questions you want to win and which modalities best support them.

For each key question (e.g. “How do I pre‑check VAT invoices before Xero?”), decide:

What should be answered in text (definition, steps, pros/cons).

What needs an image (dashboard, workflow diagram, before/after).

What benefits from video or screen recording (end‑to‑end flow, setup).

Where audio might make sense (explainer clips, podcast snippet).

Create a simple matrix:

Question / intent	Text needed	Image needed	Video/audio needed
How do I pre‑check VAT invoices before Xero?	Definition + 5‑step process	Flow diagram, UI screenshot	2–3 min walkthrough video
Best tools to reduce invoice errors for UK SMEs?	Shortlist + criteria	Comparison table screenshot	5 min “how to choose” explainer
This becomes your multimodal content spec per topic.

2. Make every asset “retrieval‑ready” on its own
Each modality must carry enough metadata and surrounding context that an AI system can retrieve and understand it even if it sees it without the rest.

For images
Use descriptive file names (e.g. vat-precheck-xero-dashboard.png).

Add precise alt text that encodes entity + use case (“Dashboard in VATMate showing VAT error flags before pushing invoices to Xero”).

Place images next to on‑topic copy that names the problem, product, and audience.

Use appropriate schema where relevant (ImageObject within Product/Article).

For video
Host on a crawlable platform (your site + YouTube/Vimeo) and embed in relevant pages.

Provide a full, human‑edited transcript on the same page.

Add chapters with question‑style titles (“How to connect VATMate to Xero”, “Reviewing failed invoices”).

Mark up with VideoObject schema; optionally Clip/SeekToAction for key segments.

For audio / podcast
Publish full transcripts with headings that mirror conversational queries.

Use clear episode titles (“How AI answer engines pick which finance tools to recommend”).

Consider speakable markup on short, summary segments suitable for voice answers.

The goal: every asset is independently understandable as an answer fragment.

3. Build a unified, multimodal “answer hub” per topic
Instead of scattering formats, create topic hubs where all modalities live together around a single intent.

Structure a hub page like:

H1: Question or intent (“How to pre‑check VAT invoices before Xero”)

Short, direct text answer (2–4 sentences).

Expanded written guide (steps, caveats, examples).

Inline:

Video embed + transcript.

Key screenshots + captions.

Downloadable assets if relevant (checklists, sample CSV).

Benefits:

Text gives LLMs an easy entry point.

Visuals and video offer rich context + snippets for multimodal systems.

Co‑location makes it more likely that retrieval systems pull multiple modalities from the same URL.

4. Align semantics across text, visuals, and audio
Multimodal retrieval works best when all modalities tell the same semantic story using the same entities and phrases.

Concretely:

Use the same product name, problem wording, and audience label in:

On‑screen UI (e.g. “VAT pre‑check for Xero”).

Alt text and image captions.

Video titles, chapter names, and spoken script.

Page headings and intro copy.

Repeat key triplets:

[Product] + [category] + [integration/stack]

[Product] + [job-to-be-done] + [audience]

Example:
“VATMate is a pre‑flight VAT checker for UK SMEs using Xero” appears:

In the first 50 words of the page.

In image captions (“VATMate pre‑flight VAT checker showing failed invoices from UK suppliers”).

In the spoken intro of the video and its title/description.

This consistency helps both text‑only and multimodal retrievers align signals across formats.

5. Implement basic hybrid retrieval in your own stack
If you’re building an AEO‑focused product or internal tooling, you can treat multimodal retrieval as hybrid search over text + visuals.

At a high level:

Index text

Use embeddings (e.g. sentence‑level) over: page copy, transcripts, alt text, FAQs.

Store in a vector DB with metadata (URL, modality tags, entities).

Index images / visual regions

Either:

Run OCR and index extracted text, and/or

Use a vision encoder to embed the whole image or specific regions (e.g. UI panels).

Attach metadata (page URL, what’s depicted, product, feature).

At query time

Convert the user question into an embedding.

Retrieve:

Top‑N text chunks from your text index.

Top‑M visual items from the image index.

Optionally fuse scores (e.g. weighted sum / reciprocal rank fusion).

Rank and assemble

Rerank candidates by:

Intent match (is it “how‑to”, “what is”, “compare”, “recommend”?).

Entity/feature match (mentions of product, integration, geography).

Surface a bundle: text snippet + relevant screenshot + recommended video segment.

Even without fancy research‑grade RAG, this gives you internal, explainable multimodal retrieval that mirrors how external answer engines will behave.

6. Add structure and metadata for external answer engines
On your public site, you can’t control external retrievers, but you can feed them richer hints:

Use schema for:

Article / HowTo + FAQPage on hubs.

VideoObject with key timestamps.

ImageObject for critical visuals.

Maintain:

Clean HTML hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3).

Fast pages, compressed but high‑quality media, alt text everywhere.

Canonical URLs for each topic hub so all signals consolidate.

Ensure:

Each hub is linked from logical places (nav, related articles, product pages).

Sitemaps include image and video sitemaps where applicable.

You’re essentially making it cheap for crawlers and AI systems to discover, parse, and reuse your multimodal assets.

7. Measure, iterate, and prune
Finally, treat multimodal retrieval as an ongoing optimization loop:

Track:

Which pages get cited or summarized by AI tools (manually sampled or via tooling).

Engagement with embedded visuals and video (heatmaps, watch time, scroll depth).

Iterate:

Promote visuals that users and AIs gravitate toward (e.g. move key diagram higher).

Split overloaded, mixed‑intent pages into cleaner, single‑intent hubs.

Prune:

Remove or consolidate outdated, conflicting visuals and videos that dilute your signals.

Standardize naming and design patterns across UI screenshots so they’re recognizable.

The mental model: you’re curating a multimodal knowledge base about what your product is, who it’s for, and how it works — and you want both humans and AI answer engines to retrieve the right slice of it in one shot.

If you share your stack (e.g. “we’re on Next.js + Supabase + a vector DB”), I can outline a very concrete implementation plan, including where to put embeddings, how to store media metadata, and how to design the topic hub templates.
