2. What we do
We provide a software‑as‑a‑service platform that measures how often brands are mentioned or recommended in AI‑generated answers for specific, user‑defined prompts and generates analytics and suggestions to improve “Answer Engine Optimization” (AEO) and AI visibility.

We use third‑party AI model providers (e.g. large language model APIs) to process the prompts you define and to generate outputs that we analyse.

3. Data we collect

Account information:
Name, email address, password (hashed), organisation name, role, and other details you provide during registration or profile setup.

Subscription plan, billing address, VAT/Tax ID, and limited payment details (we do not store full card numbers; these are handled by our payment processor, e.g. Stripe).

Customer content (“Your Data”):

Brand names, domains, competitor names.

Prompt sets and prompts you configure.

Notes, project names, and metadata.

Cookies and similar technologies:
We use necessary cookies to operate the site and may use analytics cookies to understand how the Service is used. You can control cookies via your browser settings and, where required by law, via our cookie banner/consent tool.

3.3 Data from third parties
We may receive limited personal data from:

Payment processors (e.g. status of payments, last four digits of card, expiry date).

Authentication or identity providers if you sign in with SSO (e.g. email, name, organisation).

Analytics and error‑tracking tools (e.g. aggregated usage stats, crash logs).

We do not buy marketing lists.

We process personal data only where we have a legal basis to do so (GDPR/UK GDPR).

5. How we use AI providers and APIs
When you run a scan, the prompts and related configuration you define are sent to third‑party AI model providers via their APIs. They generate responses, which we:

Store in our systems.

Score and analyse to compute AEO metrics.

We use reputable providers with commercial terms that allow API‑based processing for SaaS products. API providers may temporarily log requests and responses for abuse monitoring, security, or service quality under their own policies.

We do not have access to other users’ private conversations in those AI tools, and our metrics are based only on the prompts our Platform sends.

6. How we share personal data
We do not sell your personal data.

We may share personal data with:

Service providers / processors

Cloud hosting (e.g. infrastructure providers).

Database and storage providers.

Payment processors.

Email and notification services.

Analytics and error‑tracking tools.

These processors are bound by contract to process data only on our instructions and with appropriate security.

Professional advisers
Lawyers, accountants, auditors, and insurers, where necessary.

Authorities and legal requests
If required by law, regulation, legal process, or to protect our rights, users, or the public.

Business transfers
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, personal data may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to applicable laws and continued protection.

We may share aggregated and anonymised insights (for example, high‑level benchmarks) that do not identify individuals or specific customers.

7. International transfers
We may process and store personal data in countries other than the one you reside in (for example, if we use cloud infrastructure or processors located abroad).

Where required by law (e.g. EU/UK data leaving the EEA/UK), we implement appropriate safeguards, such as:

Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission/UK authorities, or

Other lawful transfer mechanisms.

You can contact us for more information about cross‑border transfer safeguards relevant to you.

Enforce our terms.

We may retain aggregated or anonymised data that no longer identifies you, for analytics and Service improvement.

We do not sell or “share” personal information in the sense of selling data for monetary consideration or for cross‑context behavioural advertising.

You may have the right to request:

Access to categories and specific pieces of personal information we hold about you.

Deletion of personal information (subject to exceptions).

Correction of inaccurate information.

Separation of environments and least‑privilege access.

No method of transmission or storage is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security. If we become aware of a data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to your rights and freedoms, we will notify you and/or relevant authorities as required by law.
